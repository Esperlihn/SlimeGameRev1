This is a test script for me to keep track of my thoughts on how the game will be
structred and put together.

for starters

	Pathfinding:
		The pathfinding system is going to be the heavy lifeter in this entire game
		it's got a lot of work to do comparatively to the others. The pathfinder must:
			- Keep track of all Entities on the map
			- Keep track of all objects on the map
			- Keep track of the rotation/orientation of the map
			- Keep track of which highlights are active and which are not
			- Keep track of which tiles are purely aesthetic, obstacles, or walkable.
			- Keep track of positions of all tiles, and their rotated positions.
			- Update accurately to all possible changes players and system can make
			



BORED. I AM BORED. I AM SO BAD AT MANAGING MY TIME AND TASKS.
I MUST ASSIGN MYSELF MORE TASKS TO DO.
